Hold your cork upright and draw a circle in the top, leaving a small perimeter of about 1/8″. Some corks, like the one above, even come with a pre-printed circle.

<h5>Step 2:</h5>
Next, carefully cut into your cork with your knife, tracing the line you just drew. Slice in about an inch or so, making sure not to cut past your perimeter.

<h5>Step 3:</h5>
After you have your circle cut out, use your knife to start popping out small chunks of the center of your circle.

<b>TIP:</b> Don’t throw your leftover cork shavings away! Reuse them as mulch for your plants to get even more value out of this recycling project.

<h5>Step 4:</h5>
Once you have a good amount of your cavity carved out, use your flat-head screwdriver to continue hollowing out the inside of the cork using a twisting motion. It may seem counter-intuitive, but the blunt edge of the screwdriver is actually more effective at removing chunks of the cork than a sharp knife. You can stop once you are a little more than halfway down through the cork.

<h5>Step 5:</h5>
Then scoop a small amount of soil into your hollowed out wine cork, leaving room for your plant.

Finally pop your plant in and cover the roots with a little more soil. Then place your new wine cork succulents where they’ll get plenty of sun and water them once in a while when the soil feels moist.
